mpeg-segmenter
=====================================

Starting from a MPEG-TS file, it segments the stream and prepares the M3U8 in according to
HTTP Live Streaming for iOS.

Let's suppose we want to deliver a video for iOS devices and we have a file AVI, MP4, MKV or similar 
video clip. All we need to do is:

* Convert the video in TS format. I strongly suggest to use last ffmpeg version available and use
   the presets for iOS. Some presets are available in this project.
* Use mpeg-segmenter to prepare the TS segments and M3U8 files.
* Copy the output files (.ts and .m3u8 files) generated by mpeg-segmenter in your preferred web
   server and make them available for download.
* Open Safari from your iOS and open the web location of main M3U8 file.
* Watch your VIDEO!
