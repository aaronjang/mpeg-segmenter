mpeg-segmenter
=====================================

Starting from a MPEG-TS file, it segments the stream and prepares the M3U8 in according to
HTTP Live Streaming for iOS.

Let's suppose we want to deliver a video for iOS devices and we have a file AVI, MP4, MKV or similar 
video clip. All we need to do is:

1) Convert the video in TS format. I strongly suggest to use last ffmpeg version available and use
   the presets for iOS. Some presets are available in this project.
2) Use mpeg-segmenter to prepare the TS segments and M3U8 files.
3) Copy the output files (.ts and .m3u8 files) generated by mpeg-segmenter in your preferred web
   server and make them available for download.
4) Open Safari from your iOS and open the web location of main M3U8 file.
5) Watch your VIDEO!
